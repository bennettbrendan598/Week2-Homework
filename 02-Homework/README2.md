This project helped me understand the importance of creating responsive websites. We are moving to a day and age where people have more access to cell phones and tablets than laptops and desktops. 

It also assisted me in understanding how CSS and Bootstrap work together. Bootstrap has very specific capabilities, whereas CSS can substitute anything you may not be able to do with Bootstrap alone.
