      <p class="mb-2">Music is a huge, huge, huge part of my life! I spend most of my summers traveling the country (and
        even outside the country) going to different festivals and gatherings. Since I developed this passion at the
        young age of 15, I have been working on creating my own sound. I love producing and DJ'ing house music. House
        music makes me feel a part of a larger community, and truly feeds my soul. In addition to this genre, I love
        others such as: glitch-hop, trip-hop, techno, acid-scratch, deep bass, jam, and so much more!</p>

        <h5 class="mb-1">Hiking, Camping, and other Outdoor Activities</h5>
      </div>
      <p class="mb-2">I love to stay active! I'm not really a "go-to-the-gym-5-times-a-week" type, but I LOVE taking
        beautiful hikes, or camping in scenic locations. Living in Denver is great because we are centralized between so
        many breathtaking destinations in the United States!</p>

        <h5 class="mb-1">Skiing!</h5>
      </div>
      <p class="mb-2">Unfortunately due to a shortage of income this year (thanks, COVID-19), I was unable to get an
        Ikon or Epic Pass. Although, skiing is a passion of mine. I find it so therapeutic to go down challenging runs,
        and to travel to beautiful resorts. It really brings people closer together, and instills discipline.</p>
