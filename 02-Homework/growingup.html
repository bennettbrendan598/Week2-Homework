      </div>
      <p class="mb-2">This is my hometown! Although it will always have a special place in my heart, I will never return
        (LOL!) Just across the lake from Ontario, Canada (which you could actually see on a clear day), this extremely
        small town is where I grew up. Thankfully my dad took me away from the town before I was a teenager; if he
        didn't, my life probably would've been the complete opposite of what it is now.</p>

        <h5 class="mb-1">Fairfax, Virginia</h5>
      </div>
      <p class="mb-2">Just outside of Washington D.C., this beautiful town had plenty to see and do! I loved going to
        the Smithsonian Mall, and seeing all the sights of our country's Capitol, but still not a place I would settle
        down in.</p>

        <h5 class="mb-1">Destin, Florida</h5>
      </div>
      <p class="mb-2">This is where I went through the majority of my teenage years. It was a beach, tourist town in the
        panhandle of Florida! I made a lot of great friends there, but it was kind of a hard place to be given that our
        socioeconomic status was much, much, much lower than my peers. I go back to visit occasionally, as I do still
        have some relatives in the area.</p>

        <h5 class="mb-1">Orlando, Florida</h5>
      </div>
      <p class="mb-2">Although this isn't where I technically "grew up," it is where I, without a doubt, did the most
        growing. I attended the University of Central Florida, and constantly partied. It was fun for my "coming of age"
        years, but I was eager to part ways with my lifestyle I was living.</p>

      </div>
      <p class="mb-2">Finally! Somewhere that feels like home! My boyfriend and I moved here because we've both always
        wanted to live out west! There's an outstanding music scene, beautiful nature all around, and some of the
        country's best skiing! I could not be happier than I am living here. </p>
